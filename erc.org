* Introduction

IRC in Emacs!  What could go wrong?

* Packages

Since I use a ZNC server, this helps a bit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(require-package '(erc znc))
(require 'erc)
(require 'znc)
#+end_src

* External Configuration

I have a password for my ZNC server.  I'm not version controlling it (duh).  So,
it needs to be placed in my .emacs.d directory as =ircpass=.

* Configuration

This is my server.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  (defun read-lines (path)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents path)
      (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))

  (let ((password (car (read-lines (expand-file-name "ircpass"
                                                     user-emacs-directory)))))
    (setq znc-servers
          (list (list "home.brenns10.com" 6697 t
                       (list (list 'CWRU "stephen" password))))))
#+end_src

Notification support

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-to-list 'erc-modules 'notifications)
#+end_src
