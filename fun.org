* Introduction

Fun stuff that is cute to show off.

* Packages

One of the packages we're showing off is =selectric-mode=.

* Settings

(add-to-list 'load-path (concat emacs-dir "quake-mode/"))
(load "quake-mode.el")
#+end_src

* Instructions

This little "fun" module loads two packages.  One is selectric mode, which makes
a typewriter sound after every keypress.  It's kinda annoying, but whatever.
The other package is quake mode, which just plays kill announcements whenever
you kill a large amount of text.  You can enable or disable either of those
modes by issuing their mode names as a command.  You'll need to have the program
=aplay=, which is in the Arch Linux package =alsa-utils=.  The quake-mode
program is modified by me from the original, so it's included in this repository
instead of installed from elpa.
