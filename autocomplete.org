* Introduction
I was using the auto-complete-mode, but Company Mode is better for Python.  I'll
have to get stuff working with Company Mode in C/C++.
* Implementation
** Required Packages
#+name: requirements
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require-package '(company))
;(require 'auto-complete)
#+end_src
** Settings

#+name: init
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; Enable Auto Complete
;(global-auto-complete-mode t)
;
;;; Configure Auto Complete dictionaries
;(require 'auto-complete-config)
;(add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories "~/.emacs.d/ac-dict")
;(ac-config-default)
;
;;; The yas source seems to fail a lot...
;(setq ac-source-yasnippet nil)
;
;;; When Auto-Complete auto-starts, it forces Semantic to parse the whole file.
;;; That is not behavior I want when working on large C files.
;(setq ac-auto-start nil)
;
;;; These may already be defaults.  These are keys for doing basic stuff in
;;; completion menus.
;(define-key ac-completing-map "\M-/" 'ac-stop)
;(define-key ac-completing-map "TAB" 'ac-expand)
;(define-key ac-completing-map "RET" 'ac-complete)
;
;;; And, this is the trigger key for outside of ac-completing mode.
;(ac-set-trigger-key "TAB")


#+end_src
