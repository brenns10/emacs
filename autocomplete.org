* Introduction

At one point, I used the AutoComplete package for Emacs.  However, when I
started using [[file+emacs:elpy.org][Elpy]], which required Company Mode, I had to switch.  The majority
of research seems to indicate that Company Mode is much better anyway.

* Packages

Just one right now, company-mode!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require-package '(company))
#+end_src

* Settings

Enable the company global mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-/") 'company-complete)
#+end_src
