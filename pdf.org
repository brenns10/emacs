* Introduction

  Admittedly, I really do like Okular as a PDF viewer.  But compared to being
  able to view them in Emacs, I'd prefer Emacs, because it's just so much more
  convenient (except for printing, I guess).  However, DocView mode is pretty
  bad for PDFs, because it converts to PNG at a crappy resolution.  So, PDFView
  (from pdf-tools) is my new replacement.

* Implementation

** Required Packages

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (require-package '(pdf-tools))
  (require 'pdf-tools)
#+end_src

** Settings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (pdf-tools-install)
#+end_src

Above, we "install" PDF tools.  This runs a server process to render PDFs.  If
the server process hasn't been compiled, it will do that too.  In order for the
build to work, you'll want the =poppler-glib= package installed (on Arch).
