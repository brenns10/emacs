* Introduction

This configuration file contains the instructions to make KMail work better
with Emacs.  It sets the line width to 78 so that KMail won't hard-wrap my
email.

* Implementation
** Package Installation

No packages to install.

** Modules

Add a hook to fundamental-mode so that if a buffer is opened with name that
starts with "kmail", the line-width is set to 78.

#+name: init
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq-local fill-column 78)
            (delete-trailing-whitespace)
            (message "Get ready to compose!")))
#+end_src
