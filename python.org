* Introduction
Elpy is an Emacs/Python integration package.
* Implementation
** Required Packages
#+name: requirements
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require-package '(elpy))
#+end_src
** Settings

#+name: init
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(elpy-enable)
(setq elpy-rpc-backend "jedi")
(elpy-use-ipython)
#+end_src

I prefer to have my docstrings either be all in one line, or else have the first
line separate from the quotes, and no newline at the end.  That is the
"symmetric" style of docstrings according to python-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq python-fill-docstring-style 'symmetric)
#+end_src
